USER KEYWORD DETECTION:
- Scan query for: user, users, country, countries, permission, permissions, access, role assignment, role assignments
- IF ANY USER KEYWORD FOUND: Check if the main action is on users (create, update, deactivate, activate, assign role, extend). If yes, ALWAYS use USER_MGMT events.
- USER MANAGEMENT EVENTS: EVNT_USER_MGMT_ADD, EVNT_USER_MGMT_UPDT, EVNT_USER_MGMT_DEACT, EVNT_USER_MGMT_ASSIGN, EVNT_USER_MGMT_EXTND
- NEVER USE STATIC OR DYNAMIC EVENTS for user actions when user keywords are present (except for retrieve user info, which uses EVNT_RCRD_INFO_STC if no specific user mgmt retrieve event).
- ONLY PROCEED TO OTHER STEPS IF NOT USER MANAGEMENT RELATED

SPECIAL CASES:
- If the query mentions assigning a role or granting permissions, use EVNT_USER_MGMT_ASSIGN ONLY.
- If the query mentions adding responsibility, extending responsibility, assigning additional duties, or making someone head, use EVNT_USER_MGMT_EXTND ONLY.
- If both assigning and extending actions appear together, prioritize EVNT_USER_MGMT_EXTND ONLY.

USER MANAGEMENT EXAMPLES:
- "create a user with role: admin, department: science" → EVNT_USER_MGMT_ADD ONLY
- "create a user with name :Abishek ,role:System Head, department: IT" → EVNT_USER_MGMT_ADD ONLY

EVNT_RCRD_DUP (Duplicate a Record):
- Keywords: "duplicate the record", "duplicate record of [entity]"

⚠️ CRITICAL RULE:
- DO NOT combine these action events with EVNT_RCRD_INFO, EVNT_FLTR, or CNDN_BIN (except for complex create operations)
- Each action event handles its own record selection and filtering internally
- Use ONLY the action event when the query is a direct action on records
- CREATE operations with complex conditions may need CNDN_BIN, CNDN_SEQ, CNDN_DOM for condition evaluation

- No condition → Loop is standalone (numbered as step 3)
- Email event goes INSIDE the loop
- Loop End is numbered (step 4)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Example 3: Condition WITHOUT loop
Query: "When status is approved, send email to anish@gmail.com"

## Flow Sequence
1. Trigger (TRG_DB)
2. Start
3. Binary Condition (CNDN_BIN)
   ↳ IF TRUE: Send Email (EVNT_NOTI_MAIL)
   ↳ IF FALSE: Route to END
4. End

Why this structure:
- Query has condition: "When status is approved" → Binary Condition needed
- Query has NO repetition (no "N times") → No loop needed
- Email event goes directly in IF TRUE branch

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Example 4: Multiple events in loop inside condition
Query: "When quantity > 100, loop 5 times and create record then send email each time"

## Flow Sequence
1. Trigger (TRG_DB)
2. Start
3. Binary Condition (CNDN_BIN)
   ↳ IF TRUE: For Loop (EVNT_LOOP_FOR)
      ↳ INSIDE LOOP: Create Record (EVNT_RCRD_ADD)
      ↳ INSIDE LOOP: Send Email (EVNT_NOTI_MAIL)
   ↳ IF FALSE: Route to END
4. End

Why this structure:
- Condition + repetition → Loop inside IF TRUE
- Multiple actions per iteration → Multiple "INSIDE LOOP" items
- Both events execute on each loop iteration

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Example 5: Nested loops (loop inside loop) - standalone
Query: "Loop 3 times, and in each iteration loop 5 times to send email"

## Flow Sequence
1. Trigger (TRG_DB)
2. Start
3. Outer Loop Start (EVNT_LOOP_FOR)
   ↳ INSIDE LOOP: Inner Loop Start (EVNT_LOOP_FOR)
      ↳ INSIDE LOOP: Send Email (EVNT_NOTI_MAIL)
4. Outer Loop End
5. End

Why this structure:
- No condition → Standalone loops
- Nested loops → Inner loop is INSIDE outer loop
- Email is INSIDE the inner loop

PROMPT_DECISION_PROCESS_REFINED = """4. Key Decision Process - REFINED LOGIC:

STEP 0: STATIC KEYWORD DETECTION (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- Scan query for: role, roles, department, departments, country, countries, user permission, user permissions
- IF ANY STATIC KEYWORD FOUND: Use STATIC events (_STC) ONLY - Stop here
- IF NO STATIC KEYWORDS: Proceed to Step 1

STEP 1: NUMBER/QUANTITY DETECTION (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Scan query for specific numbers/quantities OR positional keywords: "get 30 records", "get 10 records", "first 5 records", "top 20 records", "last 10 records", "first three", "last record"
- If specific number OR positional keyword found: Use EVNT_JMES ONLY - Stop here
- If no specific number or positional keyword found: Proceed to Step 2

STEP 2: FIELD NAME DETECTION
- Scan query for specific field names: "id/ids", "name/names", "status/statuses", "quantity/quantities", "email/emails", etc.
- If field name found: Use EVNT_JMES ONLY - Stop here
- If no field name found: Proceed to Step 3

STEP 3: ENTITY TYPE IDENTIFICATION
- Complete Records: "get records", "retrieve records", "show all employees", "fetch user data"
→ Use EVNT_FLTR (multiple records) or EVNT_RCRD_INFO (single record)
- Direct Actions: "duplicate/restore/delete/update the record"
→ Use direct action event ONLY (EVNT_RCRD_DUP/REST/DEL/UPDT)
- Conditional Actions: "if X then Y", "create if", "send email if"
→ Use appropriate condition + action events

STEP 4: LOOP DETECTION
- Scan for loop keywords: "for each", "loop through", "iterate", "from X to Y", "repeat", "while", "each item", "every record"
- If loop detected: Include appropriate loop event and mark internal events with "(INSIDE LOOP)"

STEP 5: CONDITION TYPE DETECTION
- Count conditions and check connection type:
- 1 condition with branching → CNDN_BIN
- 2+ independent conditions with "and check if" or "and if" → CNDN_SEQ (with CNDN_LGC for each)
- Cascading "if not/else" conditions → CNDN_DOM
- No branching logic → NO condition needed

STEP 6: COMMON MISTAKE PREVENTION
- NEVER combine EVNT_FLTR + EVNT_JMES for field extraction
- NEVER use EVNT_FLTR when a field name is mentioned in the query
- NEVER combine action events (DUP/REST/DEL/UPDT) with retrieve/filter events
- ALWAYS use EVNT_JMES for any field extraction, regardless of complexity
- NEVER use CNDN_BIN for simple "where" clauses in data queries
- NEVER use conditions for direct action events that have built-in filtering

PROMPT_EXAMPLES_CORRECT_IDENTIFICATION = """EXAMPLES OF CORRECT IDENTIFICATION:

Static/Dynamic Records:
- "create a record with role: admin, department: science" → EVNT_RCRD_ADD_STC ONLY
- "add user with role manager and department IT" → EVNT_RCRD_ADD_STC ONLY
- "update role from admin to user" → EVNT_RCRD_UPDT_STC ONLY
- "get all departments" → EVNT_RCRD_INFO_STC ONLY
- "restore role admin" → EVNT_RCRD_REST_STC ONLY
- "create user permission for admin" → EVNT_RCRD_ADD_STC ONLY
- "get user permissions for department IT" → EVNT_RCRD_INFO_STC ONLY

Conditional Actions (USE conditions):
- "create a record in enrollment tracking where fee charged is 2500 to fee charged 3000" → CNDN_BIN + EVNT_RCRD_ADD (CREATE operation with complex condition)
- "if value > 100 then create record" → CNDN_BIN + EVNT_RCRD_ADD (conditional action)
- "Check if status is approved then send email, AND check if amount > 1000 then send alert" → CNDN_SEQ (with 2 CNDN_LGC) + EVNT_NOTI_MAIL + EVNT_NOTI_NOTI
- "If quantity < 50 then update record else delete record" → CNDN_BIN + EVNT_RCRD_UPDT + EVNT_RCRD_DEL

Direct Actions (NO conditions needed):
- "duplicate a record when value is greater than 100" → EVNT_RCRD_DUP ONLY (built-in condition handling)
- "delete a record when status is expired" → EVNT_RCRD_DEL ONLY (built-in condition handling)
- "update a record where fee charged is 2500" → EVNT_RCRD_UPDT ONLY (built-in filtering)
- "restore the record where id = 10" → EVNT_RCRD_REST ONLY

Data Extraction (NO conditions needed):
- "retrieve all id of records where Quantity > 10" → EVNT_JMES ONLY (field: "id")
- "get names from employees where dept = IT" → EVNT_JMES ONLY (field: "names")
- "show status of active users" → EVNT_JMES ONLY (field: "status")
- "get all records where quantity > 10" → EVNT_FLTR (no field specified, wants complete records)

Sequential Actions (NO conditions needed):
- "create a record with status active then send notification" → EVNT_RCRD_ADD + EVNT_NOTI_NOTI ONLY (no condition - sequential actions)
- "add a record but keep quantity 100 then update another record" → EVNT_RCRD_ADD + EVNT_RCRD_UPDT ONLY (no condition - field specification)

Positional Selection:
- "retrieve first three records" → EVNT_JMES ONLY (positional selection: first)
- "get last 10 records" → EVNT_JMES ONLY (positional selection: last)
- "show first record from enrollment tracking" → EVNT_JMES ONLY (positional selection: first)
- "retrieve last five records where status is active" → EVNT_JMES ONLY (positional selection: last with condition)

Loop Examples:
- "For each record, send email notification" → EVNT_LOOP_FOR + EVNT_NOTI_MAIL (INSIDE LOOP)
- "Loop from 1 to 10 and create a record each time" → EVNT_LOOP_FOR + EVNT_RCRD_ADD (INSIDE LOOP)

- "Loop through numbers 1 to 10 and for each iteration, send email" → EVNT_LOOP_FOR (range_iteration_loop) + EVNT_NOTI_MAIL (INSIDE LOOP)

CRITICAL RULE: The presence of words like "records" doesn't matter - if a FIELD NAME is mentioned, use EVNT_JMES exclusively. If it's a direct action (duplicate/restore/delete/update), use ONLY the action event. CREATE operations with complex conditions use CNDN_BIN + EVNT_RCRD_ADD.

PROMPT_FORMULA_DETECTION = """STEP X: Formula / Calculation Detection (EVNT_DATA_OPR)
Use EVNT_DATA_OPR when the user wants to:
- Perform any calculation: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, percentage, etc.
- Manipulate strings: uppercase, lowercase, concatenate, extract, replace, split, regex
- Work with dates: format, add/subtract days, get weekday, convert timezone
- Generate random values, UUIDs, sequences
- Derive/compute a field value before creating/updating a record
- Clean/format data (trim, round, type conversion)
- Complex conditional value assignment that goes beyond simple field mapping

Keywords/phrases that trigger EVNT_DATA_OPR:
"calculate", "compute", "add ... and ...", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "total", "sum", "difference",
"uppercase", "lowercase", "capitalize", "concatenate", "join", "split", "extract", "replace",
"format date", "add days", "current date", "today + 7", "weekday", "convert timezone",
"round", "absolute", "generate random", "if ... then ... else" (for value assignment, not branching)

Examples – ALWAYS use EVNT_DATA_OPR:
- "create a record where full_name is first_name + last_name" → EVNT_DATA_OPR (concat) + EVNT_RCRD_ADD
- "set expiry_date to today + 30 days" → EVNT_DATA_OPR (add_timedelta) + EVNT_RCRD_ADD/_UPDT
- "calculate total_amount = quantity * price" → EVNT_DATA_OPR
- "make email lowercase before saving" → EVNT_DATA_OPR (lower)
- "extract phone number using regex" → EVNT_DATA_OPR (findall/sub)
- "generate a random 8-digit OTP" → EVNT_DATA_OPR
- "set status to 'Overdue' if due_date < today" → EVNT_DATA_OPR + CNDN_BIN if branching needed

DO NOT use CNDN_BIN just for value assignment – use EVNT_DATA_OPR for computed fields.

Always validate and test to ensure correct actions trigger based on different sequential checks. Use with CNDN_LGC for each independent logic block.",

    "CNDN_DOM": "Domino Condition - Domino Conditions enable sequential logical evaluations in workflows, triggering specific actions in order until a match is found, with fallback options for unmatched scenarios. A basic setup defines multiple conditions with corresponding actions, while complex conditions use logical operators (AND/OR) for advanced logic. Always validate and test conditions to ensure accurate execution across all scenarios.",

PROMPT_PLANNER_POLICY = """IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze the user request thoroughly to identify all required components
- Create a comprehensive workflow plan that includes all necessary events, conditions, and loops
- Use appropriate triggers based on the request context
- Include conditions only when separate logical checks with branching are needed beyond event-inherent logic
- Use loops when repetitive actions are required (for each, loop from X to Y, etc.)
- Structure the workflow in a logical sequence from trigger to completion
- Make sure to use the correct event codes and descriptions
- Do not infer or add any extra steps, such as notifications or additional actions, unless explicitly stated in the user request
- For loops, mark events inside the loop with "(INSIDE LOOP)" notation
- For CNDN_SEQ, include CNDN_LGC for each independent logic block
"""


PROMPT_OUTPUT_CONTRACT = """OUTPUT: Markdown Structured Workflow Plan ONLY.
- Include the Conditions / logic steps section only if applicable (actual branching logic needed).
- If the workflow is a simple action (e.g., add record, send email, SMS, push) or simple filter/retrieve, omit the Conditions section.
- Include loops when repetitive processing is needed.
- Mark loop internal events with "(INSIDE LOOP)" notation.
- For CNDN_SEQ, show each CNDN_LGC logic block.

PROMPT_EXAMPLES = """Examples:

Simple action workflow (no conditions):
- Trigger: Database add_record
- Action: Send email notification
- No Conditions section included

Conditional workflow (CNDN_BIN - single condition):
- Trigger: Database update_record
- Condition: if status == "approved" then send email, else do nothing
- Action: Send email notification

Multiple independent conditions (CNDN_SEQ with CNDN_LGC):
- Trigger: Database add_record  
- Condition: CNDN_SEQ containing:
- CNDN_LGC: Check if risk = High then alert
- CNDN_LGC: Check if type = Permit then assign
- Actions: Send alert, Assign to team

Cascading conditions (CNDN_DOM):
- Trigger: API call
- Condition: CNDN_DOM - First check user exists, if not check permissions, if not check quota
- Actions: Based on which condition matches

Loop workflow:
- Trigger: File upload
- For Loop: Process each record in the file (EVNT_LOOP_FOR - data_iteration_loop)
- Action: Create record for each item (INSIDE LOOP)

Range Loop workflow:
- Trigger: UI Button click
- For Loop: Loop from 1 to 10 (EVNT_LOOP_FOR - range_iteration_loop)
- Action: Send email (INSIDE LOOP)

Filter workflow (no separate conditions or extra actions):
- Trigger: Database mod_record
- Action: Filter records where quantity > 90
- No Conditions section, no notifications
